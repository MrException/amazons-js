The Game of Amazons
===================

For information about the rules of the game, check out the [wikipedia
page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_the_Amazons).

To play the game, I have it hosted on my website
[here](http://www.mrexception.com/amazons-js).

This is an implementation of the game, done completely using the *HTML5* *canvas*
tag. So, to play the game, you'll need a modern browser.

For now, there is no AI player. And there may never be one.

Also, you can just pretty much play against yourself, or with another person
sitting beside you at the same computer.
